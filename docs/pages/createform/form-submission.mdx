# Introduction

Once a user fills out a form, it needs to be submitted to the server. There are multiple ways to achieve this. Let's explore how to make it work.

## Submit form when deffining the form

You can configure the form submission when defining the form by using the onSubmit property of createForm. This property will be called when the form is submitted.

```jsx
import { createForm } from "@createform/react";

const form = createForm({
    onSubmit: async (values) => {
        console.log(values);
    }
})
```

## Submit form when using the hook form

Typically, when updating data, the application should redirect to another page. However, in specific cases, you may want to reload the data to display the new information using the reloadData function.

```jsx
import { createForm } from "@createform/react";

const form = createForm({
    initialValues: {
        name: "",
        email: "",
        phone: "",
    },
  
})

const FormExample = () => {
    cont {handleSubmit} = form();

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(e=>console.log(e))}>
            <input {...register("name")} />
            <input {...register("email")} />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    )
}
```

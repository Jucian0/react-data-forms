# Validation

Let's add some validation to the form. First we need to create a validation schema. As `createForm`, `useForm` allows to use Zod or Yup validation, in this example we are going to use Zod.

```jsx
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(3),
});
```

After that, we just need to add the validation schema to the form.

```jsx
import { useForm } from "@createform/react";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(3),
});

function App() {
  const { register } = useForm({ validationSchema: schema });
  return (
    <form {...register()}>
      <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" />
      <input type="submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

  You can use Yup, Zod, or your own validation library, or write your own
  validation logic.
</Callout>

title: React form with Custom Input
---

import Custom from './../src/components/custom'

## Description

When we work with react, sometimes we need a custom element to provide advanced interaction with users,
like a custom date input, custom select or a tag creator,
for all these cases we can use many options of components provided from the community.
But these custom elements cannot simulate de same events like a native element,
for this reason, useForm cannot provide same experience what useForm provide with a native element like `<input>`,
but we can use useForm to manage this kind of component like a controlled element.

Custom inputs receive generics properties, onChange, value, and property to simulate onBlur event.
When you use a custom input every change that happened in the input state is replied in state of form component because this we cannot use fell the uncontrolled inputs in custom elements.

## Instalation
```
  npm install useforms
```

```
  yarn add useforms
```

## Usage

`useForm` provides a `custom` function, this function as a link with input and a object property of form state.


Use dot notation to create advanced objects or to map object values. Type an entry name and type or an entry property object.

```jsx
   import {useForm} from 'useforms'
   import Select from 'react-select'
   import DatePicker from "react-datepicker";

   const initialValues = {
      candies:{
         iceCream:[
            { value: 'chocolate', label: 'Chocolate' }
         ]
      },
      date: new Date("05/26/2020")
   }
   
   const options = [
      { value: 'chocolate', label: 'Chocolate' },
      { value: 'strawberry', label: 'Strawberry' },
      { value: 'vanilla', label: 'Vanilla' }
      ]      

   function ControlledForm(){

      const [{values, reset},{input}] = useForm({onChange:true, initialValues})
      return (
         <>
            <Select options={options} {...custom("candies.iceCream.0")} />
            <DatePicker
               className="form-control mw-100"
               showPopperArrow={false}
               selected={values.date}
               {...custom("date")}
            /> 
         </>   
      )
   }
```

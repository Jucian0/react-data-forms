title: React form with Debounced Input

import Debounce from './../src/components/debounce'

   ## Introduction

   Debounce function forces a function to wait a certain amount of time before running again. The function is built to limit the number of times a function is called.

   The debounce parameter delays the updating of the state until the user has stopped changing inputs for a predetermined amount of time.
   <br/>
   The input value be set to state values and then updated via React events. 
   Defining a formâ€™s input value via state is considered a controlled component.
   For controlled inputs you will need a corresponding state and then a function to update that state with changes.

   <span style={{color:"#5bc0be"}}>

   </span>

   <br/>
   It means that every change in state your component, it is mounted again.

   If you want to use this kind of form, you need only pass property `debounce:300` whit a time in object received in `useForm` hook.
   
   Also, it means that the validations are run in every state change, providing better user feedback.
   See more in Controlled Inputs with validation.

   ## Instalation
   ```
   npm install useforms
   ```

   ```
   yarn add useforms
   ```

   ## Usage

   `useForm` provides a `input` function, this function as a link with input and a object property of form state.

   ```javascript
   import {useForm} from 'useforms'

   /*
   *  initial Values optional
   */
   const initialValues = {
      data1:"test",
      data2:"test2",
      complextData:[
         {
         first:"testComplexData",
         score:45
         }
      ]
   }

   const [{values},{input}] = useForm({initialValues, debounce:300})
   ```

Use dot notation to create advanced objects or to map object values. Type an entry name and type or an entry property object.

   ```jsx
   <input {...input("data1", "number")}/>
   <input {...input("complexData.0.first", "text")}/>

                        /*or*/
   <input {...input({name:"complexData.0.score", type:"number"})}/>
   ```

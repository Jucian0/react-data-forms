Normally when we want to make a form we should think about which approach we are going to use; controlled or uncontrolled or debounce input. When we use useForm we can make the three aproach the same way, it is possible because useform has a function to register inputs and that function can make all kinds of input.

## Usage

### input function
The input function registers an input HTML tag. You can pass input tag or input name and type properties respectively.

```jsx
   import {useForm} from 'useforms'

   const [{values, reset, onSubmit},{input}] = useForm({onChange:true, initialValues})

   <input {...input({name:"input-name", type:"text", required:true ....})}>
                     /*or*/
   <input {...input("input-name", "text")}>
```

### custom function 

The `custom` function registers a custom component like Custom Selects, Custom DatePiker. Custom inputs change your internal state every time the onChange event is dispatched, this means the `custom` function not support uncontrolled inputs.
 
```jsx
   import {useForm} from 'useforms'

   const [{values, reset, onSubmit},{custom}] = useForm({onChange:true, initialValues})

   <CustomINput {...custom("custom-select")}>

```
